# DS and algo

## Time complexity and Big O notation
- It is an method to clasiify how scalable is the algo is, and ait allow us to estimate the worst case of an algo or 
how long the algo takes based on the input size.

1. O(1) constant - as the input increase but the operations performed remains the same as hence it is constant.
2. O(n) -linear  - as the input increases the operations in proportional to the input and hence it gets increased based on input.
3. O(n^2)
4. O(log n)-Binary search
